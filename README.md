Description:
  A custom implementation of an associative array class with a custom binary tree. Each
  tree stores a key (string) and its corresponding data (int).
  
How to Use:
  Run the program, uses very basic testing method. No user input (other than
  typing in a file to save to).

Known Bugs/Problems:
  Not enough time as of now for menu implementation or operator[] overloading,
  The functions on a basic level work, but as far as testing goes, what is 
  shown in main is what works properly and tested.
